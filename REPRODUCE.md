# Reproducing the results

The Makefile is the public verification interface.  Run commands from the
repository root after creating the Python environment described in the main
[README](README.md).

## Fast structural check

```bash
make check
```

This compiles the active Python code, checks local Markdown links, and audits
the single status ledger.

## Stable core

```bash
make verify-minimal
make verify-core
make verify-foundations
```

`verify-minimal` uses only the Python standard library for the foundational
map.  `verify-core` adds the cubic marked-root and exact-image implementations.
Its normalized-factorization certificate checks both polynomial compositions
across `a=0`, residual-torus equivariance, determinant `-1` for normalized
multiplication, and the two explicit linear changes recovering the announced
map.
It also checks the normalized `(2,3)` factorization slice: the unimodular
boundary lattice, class `L^5-L^3`, direct counts `q^5-q^3` for four small
prime fields, and generic degree ten.  The script checks the algebraic and
arithmetic certificates; it does not promote a virtual Hodge polynomial to
individual cohomology groups.
The same target verifies the general weight-`(1,-1,-k)` invariant-coordinate
Jacobian reduction for `k=1,2,3,4`, including the foundational
`(-2,-1,1)` output weights.  It then reconstructs the complete
sixteen-monomial coefficient ideal, proves the gauge-fixed dual-number
presentation, extracts the infinitesimal deformation and its quadratic
obstruction, and separates it from the affine left--right orbit.  The same
target independently rewrites that normalized ideal as three univariate
weighted-Wronskian layers and checks its exact Poisson-square and tangent-pencil
identities.  The leading layer exposes the quadratic obstruction directly,
and two further unit-ideal checks eliminate both one-sided nonconstant-`C`
boundary charts.
`verify-foundations` adds the weighted construction and its clean-room checker.

The remaining constant-`C` boundary has a separate exact Singular
certificate:

```bash
make verify-weighted-boundary
```

It computes exactly two primary components, checks their declared radicals,
and verifies that the reduced affine-three-space components meet in an
affine plane.

The reduced global attachment of the open torus orbit is checked by

```bash
Singular -q scripts/verify_foundational_reduced_gluing.sing
```

This verifies the degree-ten toric closure and its two boundary lines.

The heavier regression target also checks the explicit degree-five family and
its rank-two symplectic descent:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/verify_degree_five_rank_two_descent.py
```

This exact calculation constructs the relative Hamiltonian over
`Q(lambda)`, extracts all four negative-`X` residue coefficients, proves the
unique parameter-dependent shear cancels them, and verifies the normalized
base brackets and polynomial source automorphism.  It normally takes roughly
half a minute in the pinned symbolic environment.

The full normalized degree-five seed surface is checked by

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/verify_degree_five_flux_surface.py
```

This exact two-parameter calculation works over `Q(a,tau,s_2)`, verifies the
uniform adapted coordinate and quotient brackets, extracts the complete four
term Laurent obstruction, and proves that its unique quadratic shear makes
the Hamiltonian polynomial.  It takes several minutes in the pinned symbolic
environment.

The separately authored Lean certificate is optional because it downloads a
pinned toolchain:

```bash
make verify-lean-foundational
```

GitHub Actions runs this target in the required `formal-lean` job using the
pinned upstream commit and Lean action.  The `papers` job compiles all three
maintained papers, and `macaulay2-independent-check` runs the pinned
Macaulay2 comparison.  Together with the four Python matrix jobs, these are
the complete CI verification pipeline.  The final `verification-complete`
job is the single aggregation check intended for GitHub branch protection.

## Cancellation programme

```bash
make verify-master
```

This runs the construction, parameter arithmetic, boundary, monodromy, and
current-ansatz rigidity regressions.  It includes the endpoint-moment
reduction of the cancellation contact resultant: the general triangular
identity is checked exactly on a bounded grid, while the complete `r=1,2`
columns are proved symbolically with `m` left as a parameter.

## External quartic islands

Juntang Zhuang's pinned `F4a`, `F4b`, and `F4c` examples have an independent
compact reconstruction and canonical-boundary audit:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/verify_external_quartic_islands.py
```

This command is also part of `make verify-regressions`.  It requires no
network access and does not copy or execute the upstream checker.

## External consequence identities

Christopher D. Long's direct Gaussian-moment and `(xz)` identities, together
with the exact normalization of the foundational map used in his BCW
discussion, have a dedicated target:

```bash
make verify-external-consequences
```

The Gaussian and `(xz)` scripts use only the Python standard library.  Their
bounded exact regressions are distinguished from Long's written all-exponent
proofs.  A companion symbolic checker proves the `SU(2)=S^3` Haar density in
Hopf coordinates, completing the local integration proof.  The same target
also performs all 18 balanced BCW steps and checks the resulting 79-variable
cubic-homogeneous collision, writes its sparse artifact, and replays it with a
separate standard-library implementation.  It then runs the shared-factor
optimization, which introduces 13 variables, reaches degree three in
dimension 16, and writes and replays a 33-variable baseline artifact.  It then
computes the exact rational rank 7 of the cubic component vector, constructs
the rank-compressed 24-variable cubic collision, and independently replays
the factorization, sparse map, and collision using only the standard library.
It then removes the two-dimensional constant Jacobian kernel, constructs the
22-variable quotient, and independently replays `BK=0`, `BC=I`, `H=HCB`,
cubic homogeneity, the descended collision, and the triangular determinant
factorization using only the standard library.
Finally, the essential-dimension search freezes a different 17-dimensional
trace of cubic-output rank six, homogenizes it in 24 variables, removes its
three-dimensional constant kernel, and independently replays the resulting
21-variable collision from the original map using only the standard library.
A final generator uses the first collision-coordinate values `0,1,-1` to fix
the multiplier `z_0`, expands the direct 60-term Special Image witness, and
expands the associated 42-variable Laplacian/Hessian-nilpotent quartic:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/generate_image_vanishing_counterexamples.py
```

The all-order nonvanishing proof is written in
[`IMAGE_VANISHING_COUNTEREXAMPLES.md`](extended-geometry/IMAGE_VANISHING_COUNTEREXAMPLES.md);
the generator checks the finite artifact and change-of-variable identities.
A local proof of the
fixed-dimensional DVEZ/Zhao implication, including Gaussian contraction, the
countable-union step, and formal inversion, completes the nonexplicit route to
`not GMC(42)`; `not GMC(158)` remains the exact conservative Long-route bound.
It also verifies the uniform weighted-seed Gaussian bridge:
first the standalone Gaussian--Lagrange identity for a nonlinear polynomial
map with nonzero constant terms, then the exact pencil branch, polynomial
determinant correction, and bounded Wick moments for canonical and split
seeds.  It also reverts the mixed-moment generating series to recover a
symbolic quartic and a concrete weighted quintic exactly, followed by a
separate standard-library reconstruction.  The
all-order completed-ring and residue proof is
[`FORMAL_GAUSSIAN_LAGRANGE_LEMMA.md`](extended-geometry/FORMAL_GAUSSIAN_LAGRANGE_LEMMA.md);
the bounded exact script is explicitly a regression rather than a substitute
for that proof.  These checks are part of
`verify-regressions`, not `verify-minimal`.

The same target runs the rank-two Poisson pre-audit and the independent
completion certificate.  The first verifies that the
single displayed output `R=x(2-3xq)` is exactly the foundational third output
after a polynomial source automorphism, and proves that the naive choices
`S=F_1/2`, `T=F_2` have no polynomial `D`-completion.  The second derives the
pole-cancelling shear `Z -> Z-9Q^2`, constructs exact polynomial `T,D,S`,
checks all six brackets and determinant one, and transports the complete
three-point fiber.  A dependency-free sparse-polynomial implementation then
rebuilds the formulas and separately checks all six brackets, the determinant,
term counts, and collision.  This proves a repository rank-two Poisson
theorem; it does not assert that these are the unavailable manuscript's
formulas.

The generated certificates are stored as the conservative
[`79-variable artifact`](artifacts/generated-results/long_bcw_79_counterexample.json)
and optimized
[`33-variable artifact`](artifacts/generated-results/shared_bcw_33_counterexample.json),
together with the
[`24-variable rank-compressed artifact`](artifacts/generated-results/rank_compressed_bcw_24_counterexample.json)
and final
[`22-variable constant-kernel quotient`](artifacts/generated-results/constant_kernel_bcw_22_counterexample.json),
together with the new
[`21-variable essential quotient`](artifacts/generated-results/essential_bcw_21_counterexample.json)
and its
[`21/42-dimensional Image and Vanishing witnesses`](artifacts/generated-results/image_vanishing_counterexamples_21_42.json).
They record the sparse cubic maps, every reduction-step choice, and the three
exact collision points, together with the expanded contraction and quartic
polynomials; regeneration is deterministic.

## Complete active suite

```bash
make verify
```

## Canonical degreewise paper

The canonical statement and proof are in the standalone paper; the five-lemma
verification companion is
[`DEGREEWISE_MULTIPLICITY_AUDIT.md`](DEGREEWISE_MULTIPLICITY_AUDIT.md).  Build
the paper with:

```bash
cd papers/marked-root-multiplicity
latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error main.tex
```

To compile every maintained paper with the same target used by CI, run:

```bash
make verify-papers
```

To retain an environment record and complete log under `artifacts/`, run:

```bash
make verify-logged
```

Generated outputs, bounded scans, and exploratory search programs are not
part of the public proof navigation.  Existing generated artifacts live under
`artifacts/generated-results/`; historical search tools are preserved under
`archive/tooling/`.

## Plane degree-frontier audit

The small deterministic regression of the published candidate tables is:

```bash
python3 plane-jc/cas/frontier_125_150.py
```

The exact chart-aware boundary localization/Smith-normal-form prefilter is:

```bash
.venv/bin/python plane-jc/cas/boundary_lattice_prefilter.py
```

The exact 90 MB certificate archive and extracted replay source are pinned
under `plane-jc/external/zenodo-21479814/`.  Attachment hashes, environment
versions, the full replay command, and the independent hard-certificate
command are in
[`plane-jc/cas/README.md`](plane-jc/cas/README.md).  The independent checker
does not import the primary CAS or generation modules.
